# Made of Bits

A little library of bit-based data structures.

Still under construction and primarily composed of bit vectors designed for efficient rank and select operations over static data, each specialized to a different data pattern: bitsets with and without repetition, dense, sparse, and run-length encoded.

The near- to medium-term future plans include documentation of the existing structures, the addition of basic benchmarking infrastructure to gather performance data, and the addition of a [wavelet matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570866713000610) with batch-oriented functionality.
